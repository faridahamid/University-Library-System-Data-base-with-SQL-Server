This project is a complete **University Library Management System** developed using **Microsoft SQL Server** for the database backend and **C# Windows Forms** (WinForms) for the frontend GUI. It demonstrates how to design, implement, and interact with a relational database in a desktop application environment.

##  Project Overview

The system supports common library operations such as:

- Inserting new books, students, and borrowing records
- Updating and modifying records
- Deleting unwanted entries
- Selecting and viewing data through search and filtering

The database was designed with:
- A **Conceptual ERD** to outline entities and relationships
- A **Physical ERD** to implement the structure in SQL Server
